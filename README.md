Working with lists in Python using import random, sort(), range(), for loops and conditionals

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1.Start by making an empty list. Use a loop to add twelve random integers between 50 and 80, inclusive, to the list. Sort the list in descending order from highest to lowest. Use a loop to print the sorted list elements on one line separated by single spaces. Determine if 66 is in the list and generate some appropriate output.

2.  Print the largest element in the list and the smallest element in the list. Slice out the five elements with indexes 4 through 8 and assign to a variable. Print the  slice. Print the total of all five elements in this slice. Use a while loop to display all elements in the slice on one line separated by tabs.
